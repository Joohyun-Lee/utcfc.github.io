## Welcome to the CFC Wiki! 
  
:::
 
Maintained by the [Cosmic Frontier Center](https://astronomy.utexas.edu/cosmic-frontier-center/about-cosmic-frontier-center) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://astronomy.utexas.edu/), this site serves as a repository of information and ideas centered around the central scientific themes of the CFC: the origins of the first stars, galaxies and black holes. 
By astronomers and (primarily) for astronomers, the Wiki aims to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the community. 
It is designed to be a living document, evolving as new ideas emerge, and helping members of our community to keep up with the rapid pace of new discoveries and bridge the gaps between subfields, e.g. theory and observations.

### Articles

_High-level overviews of key topics relevant to cosmic dawn._

Topics range from broad overviews on entire subfields, such as [reionization]() or [AGN](), to technical deep-dives into particular methods or properties.

### Data

_Up-to-date compilations of published data._

The Wiki maintains several compiled datasets, including samples of [high-redshift galaxies](pages/data/highz.qmd) and [broad-line AGN](pages/data/blagn.qmd), to facilitate use in publications and analysis.
