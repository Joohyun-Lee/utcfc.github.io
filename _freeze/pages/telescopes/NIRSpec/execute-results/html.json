It is ideal for high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources or small extended objects.\n\n### Integral Field Unit (IFU) Spectroscopy\n\nThe IFU mode provides spatially resolved spectroscopy, allowing astronomers to obtain a spectrum at each point within a 3D field of view. \nThis is particularly useful for studying the detailed structure and kinematics of extended objects like galaxies and nebulae.\n\n### Micro-Shutter Array (MSA) Spectroscopy\n\nThe MSA consists of an array of tiny shutters that can be individually opened or closed to select multiple targets within the field of view. This mode is highly efficient for observing large numbers of objects simultaneously, such as stars in a cluster or galaxies in a deep field survey.\n\n## Gratings/dispersers\n\nNIRSpec employs several gratings and a prism to disperse light into its component wavelengths:\n\n- **PRISM**: Provides low-resolution spectroscopy over the entire wavelength range, useful for broad spectral surveys and redshift measurements.\n- **Gratings**: Three medium-resolution gratings (G140M, G235M, G395M) and three high-resolution gratings (G140H, G235H, G395H) cover different portions of the near-infrared spectrum, allowing for detailed studies of spectral lines and chemical compositions.\n\n\n\n```python\n   import numpy as np\n   print('hello world')\n```\n\n::: {#a8459c43 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n   import numpy as np\n   print('hello world')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nhello world\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
