"Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are a recently discovered population of faint, red, compact sources with broad emission lines identified in deep JWST imaging and spectroscopy. 
First identified in NIRCam grism data, these objects appear to be low-mass active galactic nuclei ([AGN](agn.qmd)) at high redshifts ($z \sim 4$-$9$), providing new insights into black hole growth and evolution in the early universe. Their abundance may challenge previous models of [black hole seeding](bhseeding.qmd) and growth, suggesting more efficient accretion mechanisms in the early universe.


## History

The term "Little red dot" was coined by @matthee2024 alongside their identification of numerous [broad-line AGN](blagn.qmd) in NIRCam grism data from the [FRESCO](surveys/fresco.qmd) and [EIGER](surveys/eiger.qmd) surveys. 
Arguably, however, the LRDs were known previously, reported by @labbe2023 as "double break" galaxies from early imaging from the [CEERS](surveys/ceers.qmd) survey. 
Similar to [Lyman break galaxies](lbgs.qmd), these were identified with a color-color selection to capture objects with strong Lyman breaks and [Balmer breaks](balmerbreaks.qmd). 

Key observational characteristics include:
- Extremely compact morphology, often indistinguishable from a point source
- Red colors in the rest-frame optical (typically $F277W - F444W > 1$)
- Broad H$\alpha$ and/or H$\beta$ emission lines with typical FWHM of 1000-2500 km/s
- Evidence for significant dust obscuration


## Examples

@kokorev2023c report the spectroscopic identification of an LRD at $z=8.50$ from the [UNCOVER](surveys/uncover.qmd) survey. 


## Selection

Selection of LRDs is. 

Not all BLAGN are LRDs, and not all LRDs are BLAGN, but it is not yet established how well the two populations overlap. 


## Spectral energy distribution

The LRD SED has been the subject of a lot of work. 
It is characterized by a composite SED shape that is blue in the rest-frame UV (e.g., with [UV slope](uvslopes.qmd) $\beta \lesssim -1$) but red in the rest-frame optical ($\beta_{\rm opt} \gtrsim 0$). @setton2024b stacked [RUBIES](surveys/rubies.qmd) spectra and found that this turnover typically occurs at the Balmer limit.

## Demographics

Recent studies have measured the number density of LRDs to be approximately:
$n \sim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \sim 4$-$6$ 
Higher than expected based on extrapolations from luminous quasar populations
Significant field-to-field variations suggesting possible environmental dependencies

Possible increase in number density from $z \sim 8$ to $z \sim 5$, followed by a decline


## Theoretical Implications

### Black Hole Seeding and Growth

The discovery of numerous low-mass AGN at high redshifts has significant implications for black hole formation theories:
- Challenges models requiring long growth timescales for seed black holes
- Supports scenarios involving more efficient accretion mechanisms in the early universe
- May favor heavy seed formation channels (direct collapse black holes) in some cases

### Connection to Reionization
The role of LRDs in reionization remains an active area of investigation:
- Potential contribution to the ionizing photon budget, though likely subdominant to star-forming galaxies
- Possible feedback effects on surrounding intergalactic medium
- Questions about escape fraction of ionizing radiation from these dusty systems
