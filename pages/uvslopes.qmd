## Introduction

The ultraviolet (UV) continuum slope ($\beta$, where $f_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{\beta}$) serves as a key diagnostic for understanding the physical properties of high-redshift galaxies. 
An observable sensitive to dust attenuation, stellar populations, metallicity, and star formation history, $\beta$ can provide valuable insight into galaxy evolution across cosmic time. 
The UV slope is also one of the few quantities readily observable in high-redshift [Lyman break galaxies](lbg.qmd), since the rest-frame UV continuum is shifted into the optical/near-IR and the continuum slope can be measured via photometry alone.
[JWST](telescopes/JWST.qmd) has provided new insight into UV slopes at high redshifts ($z > 7$), probing deeper into the early universe than previously possible with Hubble Space Telescope ([HST](telescopes/HST.qmd)).

## History

Pre-JWST history, e.g. @calzetti1994, @finkelstein2012, @dunlop2012, @wilkins2013


## Measurement

Broadly, the UV slope can be measured two ways: 

1. Direct power-law fits to the data (fitting $f_\lambda \propto \lambda^\beta$) 
2. SED model fitting, in a full Bayesian context, where $\beta$ is derived from the posterior SED

Each technique has their pros and cons, and can show systematic differences in $\beta$ between the two. 

It is possible to measure $\beta$ with photometry alone, but this can create some issues. The choice of broadband filters can impact the derived $\beta$. Contamination from emission lines can also impact broadband-derived slopes at specific redshifts. 

Spectroscopy makes it easier, if SNR is sufficient. 
Calzetti windows to avoid emission line contribution. 

[Nebular continuum](neb_cont.qmd) emission can significantly impact $\beta$ measurements in very young galaxies. 
This is primarily due to free-bound emission, which is quite red at UV wavelengths. 
If the UV light is dominated by the nebular component, the slope can appear redder than the intrinsic stellar continuum slope. 

## Key JWST Observations

### UV Slope Measurements at $z > 10$

JWST has enabled robust measurements of $\beta$ in galaxies at $z > 10$

### Evolution of $\beta$ with Redshift

- Overall trend of bluer (more negative) $\beta$ values with increasing redshift from $z \sim 4$ to $z \sim 12$


## Implications for Stellar Populations and Dust 

- JWST observations indicate extremely low dust content in the earliest galaxies ($z > 10$), with $A_V$ typically $< 0.1$
- First evidence for non-zero dust attenuation in some bright $z > 10$ systems, challenging assumptions about dust formation timescales
- Extremely blue slopes ($\beta < -2.7$) in some high-$z$ sources suggest very young stellar populations with ages $< 10$ Myr

## Connection to Ionizing Photon Escape

- Blue UV slopes support scenarios where low-mass galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget during reionization
- Correlations between $\beta$ and inferred Lyman continuum escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}$) in some samples
- Constraints on the production rate of ionizing photons ($\dot{n}_{\rm ion}$) based on JWST-measured UV slopes and luminosity functions
