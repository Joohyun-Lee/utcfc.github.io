Summary of UV slopes in high-z galaxies. 
The slope of the UV continuum is sensitive to dust attenuation and stellar population properties. 


Recent studies using JWST have provided new insights into the rest-frame UV beta slopes of high-redshift galaxies. 
@morales2024 report the UV slopes in [NGDEEP](surveys/ngdeep.qmd).
