## Introduction

The ultraviolet (UV) continuum slope ($\beta$, where $f_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{\beta}$) serves as a key diagnostic for understanding the physical properties of high-redshift galaxies. 
An observable sensitive to dust attenuation, stellar populations, metallicity, and star formation history, $\beta$ can provide valuable insight into galaxy evolution across cosmic time. 
The UV slope is also one of the few quantities readily observable in high-redshift [Lyman break galaxies](lbg.qmd), since the rest-frame UV continuum is shifted into the optical/near-IR and the continuum slope can be measured via photometry alone.
[JWST](telescopes/JWST.qmd) has provided new insight into UV slopes at high redshifts ($z > 7$), probing deeper into the early universe than previously possible with Hubble Space Telescope ([HST](telescopes/HST.qmd)).

## Measurement

Broadly, the UV slope can be measured two ways: 
1. Direct power-law fits to the data (fitting $f_\lambda \propto \lambda^\beta$) 
2. SED model fitting, in a full Bayesian context, where $\beta$ is derived from the posterior SED
Each technique has their pros and cons, and can show systematic differences in $\beta$ between the two. 

It is possible to measure $\beta$ with photometry alone, but this can create some issues. The choice of broadband filters can impact the derived $\beta$. Contamination from emission lines can also impact broadband-derived slopes at specific redshifts. 

Spectroscopy makes it easier, if SNR is sufficient. 
Calzetti windows to avoid emission line contribution. 


[Nebular continuum](neb_cont.qmd) emission can significantly impact $\beta$ measurements in very young galaxies. 
This is primarily due to free-bound emission, which is quite red at UV wavelengths. 
If the UV light is dominated by the nebular component, the slope can appear redder than the intrinsic stellar continuum slope. 

## Key JWST Observations

### UV Slope Measurements at $z > 10$

JWST has enabled robust measurements of $\beta$ in galaxies at $z > 10$, with some detections pushing to $z \sim 13$-$16$. Early results show:

- Mean $\beta$ values of approximately $-2.2$ to $-2.5$ for typical $z \sim 10$-$12$ galaxies, suggesting very low dust content and young stellar populations
- Significant scatter in $\beta$ at fixed UV luminosity, potentially indicating diverse star formation histories even in the early universe
- First constraints on the $\beta$-$M_{\rm UV}$ relation at $z > 10$, showing a tentative flattening compared to lower redshifts

### Evolution of $\beta$ with Redshift

JWST has refined our understanding of the redshift evolution of UV slopes:

- Overall trend of bluer (more negative) $\beta$ values with increasing redshift from $z \sim 4$ to $z \sim 12$
- A possible plateau in the redshift evolution at $z > 9$, where mean $\beta$ values stabilize around $-2.4 \pm 0.2$
- Evidence for rapid evolution in $\beta$ between $z \sim 7$-$9$, potentially tracing the build-up of dust and metals in early galaxies

### Luminosity Dependence

The $\beta$-$M_{\rm UV}$ relation has been extended to fainter magnitudes and higher redshifts:

- Confirmation of the $\beta$-$M_{\rm UV}$ relation persisting to $z > 10$, where brighter galaxies exhibit redder slopes
- Detection of ultra-faint galaxies ($M_{\rm UV} > -18$) at $z > 8$ with extremely blue slopes ($\beta \sim -2.8$ to $-3.0$)
- Evidence for steepening of the $\beta$-$M_{\rm UV}$ relation at the highest redshifts, though sample incompleteness remains a concern

## Physical Implications

### Dust Content and Evolution

- JWST observations indicate extremely low dust content in the earliest galaxies ($z > 10$), with $A_V$ typically $< 0.1$
- First evidence for non-zero dust attenuation in some bright $z > 10$ systems, challenging assumptions about dust formation timescales
- Significant galaxy-to-galaxy variation in inferred dust properties at fixed redshift and luminosity

### Stellar Populations

- Extremely blue slopes ($\beta < -2.7$) in some high-$z$ sources suggest very young stellar populations with ages $< 10$ Myr
- Evidence for diverse star formation histories even at $z > 10$, with some galaxies showing signs of more mature stellar populations ($\beta \sim -2.0$ to $-2.2$)
- Potential metallicity effects on $\beta$, though difficult to disentangle from dust and age effects with current data

### Implications for Reionization

- Blue UV slopes support scenarios where low-mass galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget during reionization
- Correlations between $\beta$ and inferred Lyman continuum escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}$) in some samples
- Constraints on the production rate of ionizing photons ($\dot{n}_{\rm ion}$) based on JWST-measured UV slopes and luminosity functions

## Open Questions and Future Work

1. Does the $\beta$-$M_{\rm UV}$ relation evolve in slope or normalization (or both) at the highest redshifts?
2. What drives the observed scatter in $\beta$ at fixed redshift and luminosity?
3. How well do $\beta$-derived dust estimates agree with direct far-IR measurements for the brightest high-$z$ sources?
4. What is the connection between UV slope and ionizing photon production/escape in early galaxies?
5. Are there galaxies at $z > 10$ with anomalously red slopes, potentially indicating very early dust formation or AGN activity?
