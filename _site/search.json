It is ideal for high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources or small extended objects.\n\n\nIntegral Field Unit (IFU) Spectroscopy\nThe IFU mode provides spatially resolved spectroscopy, allowing astronomers to obtain a spectrum at each point within a 3D field of view. This is particularly useful for studying the detailed structure and kinematics of extended objects like galaxies and nebulae.\n\n\nMicro-Shutter Array (MSA) Spectroscopy\nThe MSA consists of an array of tiny shutters that can be individually opened or closed to select multiple targets within the field of view. This mode is highly efficient for observing large numbers of objects simultaneously, such as stars in a cluster or galaxies in a deep field survey.",

Once installed, from within the utcfc.github.io directory, the command\nquarto preview\nwill render a live preview on your local machine. Note that you don’t need to run a full render locally, as this is done automatically when new updates are pushed to the remote repository.\nIf you’re editing in VS Code, the quarto extension can do the same thing, but integrated into your editor. It also provides markdown syntax highlighting/linting, shortcuts for running code inline, autocomplete of citation keys, and more.",

An observable sensitive to dust attenuation, stellar populations, metallicity, and star formation history, \\(\\beta\\) can provide valuable insight into galaxy evolution across cosmic time. The UV slope is also one of the few quantities readily observable in high-redshift Lyman break galaxies, since the rest-frame UV continuum is shifted into the optical/near-IR and the continuum slope can be measured via photometry alone. JWST has provided new insight into UV slopes at high redshifts (\\(z &gt; 7\\)), probing deeper into the early universe than previously possible with Hubble Space Telescope (HST)."

An observable sensitive to dust attenuation, stellar populations, metallicity, and star formation history, \\(\\beta\\) can provide valuable insight into galaxy evolution across cosmic time. The UV slope is also one of the few quantities readily observable in high-redshift Lyman break galaxies, since the rest-frame UV continuum is shifted into the optical/near-IR and the continuum slope can be measured via photometry alone. JWST has provided new insight into UV slopes at high redshifts (\\(z &gt; 7\\)), probing deeper into the early universe than previously possible with Hubble Space Telescope (HST)."
